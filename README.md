# Powdery-Mildew-Leaf-Classification
Overview
This project aims to classify leaf images based on their susceptibility using a deep learning model. The frontend is built using React.js, and the backend utilizes FastAPI. The core of the classification is powered by the EfficientNet B3 model.

Features
Leaf Image Classification: The deep learning model classifies leaf images into categories based on their susceptibility.

React.js Frontend: A user-friendly web interface built with React.js allows users to interact with the classification system easily.

FastAPI Backend: The backend, powered by FastAPI, handles requests, communicates with the deep learning model, and provides seamless integration with the frontend.

EfficientNet B3 Model: The deep learning model, EfficientNet B3, is employed for accurate and efficient leaf image classification.
